Gives an example of code that is used to connect to Firebase. Please be aware that you will have a firebase.js like this one has but the info in it will be unique.

You should use this code as a guide as to how you can connect the following Repo to Firebase.


The video for this App that you must use is:
Play Video

The link for the Repo that you must use is: https://github.com/codebucks27/React-Todo-app

Please note: these aren't videos on how to connect to firebase. You may choose to watch any video or consult with firebase documentation to complement the example that I have provided.


Requirements for this homework assignment.

1. Retain the "look" of the ToDo App. But add Firebase -include (or change existing) functions which help to Create, Read, Update, and Delete in the Firebase Database. Becasue the App will be conncted to a Firebase Database, the data for the App should survive from one use to another.
The following Playlist demonstrates how to bring about "Create" "Read" "Update" and "Delete" with Firebase database:
